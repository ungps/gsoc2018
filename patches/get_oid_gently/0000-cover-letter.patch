Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/6] *** SUBJECT HERE ***

At the moment, `get_oid()` might call `die()` in some cases. To
prevent that from happening, this patches introduces a new flag
called `GET_OID_GENTLY` and a new function `get_oid_gently()`,
which passes the mentioned flag further to `get_oid_with_context()`.

The call graph of `get_oid()` is pretty complex and I hope I covered
all the cases where `exit()` might be called. Although I believe this
series of patches will not introduce any regression and work as
intended, I think that is better to mark it with [RFC].

This patch would be useful for converting `git stash` to C. At the
moment, `git stash` spawns a child process to avoid `get_oid()` to
die. If this series turns out to be good enough to be accepted, do
I need to wait until it gets merged in `master` to use it in the
other project mentioned before?

Thanks,
Paul
